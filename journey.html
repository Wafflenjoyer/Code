      <h2>My Technology Journey</h2>
      <p>My interest in technology began in Middle school when I had torn down my first computer nad had a blast doing it.</p>

      <p>Ever since I joined Highschool I have made multiple achievements in the Cyber and computer felid including becoming CompTIA Certified and competing in multiple cybersecurity competitions.
        These competitions have given me a great amount of experience in the field and I am excited to see where my journey takes me especially since i have competed in National Cyber League,
        Cyber Start, Cyber Patriot, National Cyber Cup, and Cyber Seed. I also have multiple hands on experiences with real world IT problems with working in my Cybersecurity class 
        as I have been exposed to different types of trouble shooting problems and different "Hackling opportunities" as well as working on a team to accomplish a task at hand.
      </p>
      </ul>

      <p>Through these experiences, I have learned many different skills in the industry including LInux and programming as well as trouble shooting and networking. </p>

      <p>Looking ahead, I am eager to advance my skills and learn more about networking and how computers use the internet in conjunction with one another. </p>
