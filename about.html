      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Aiden Smith. I am a current highschool student who is enrolled at Shadow Ridge High School in Las Vegas Nevada where I have been given the opportunity to study Computer Science at the University of Las Vegas.
        I have successfully completed and passed CS135 while also enrolling in EDW135 and coming to an end of the course. I am currently unemployed with no prior work experience but I am a dedicated and eager 
        to learn and I am a student who is willing to learn and overcome challenges when faced with them. I also love to work with my hands and would love to also be a mechanic as a career as I also have a passion for working with cars.
      </p>
      <p>Some of my favorite hobbies include working with computers like coding and playing video games. I also enjoy working with my hands in trades including automotive and carpentry. 
        One day I hope to be able to get my own woodworking shop while also working as a mechanic as they are two of my favorite passions. I also work on small automotive 
        maintenance projects including things like Oil changes, brakes replacement, and small engine parts replacements including seals and worn parts. 
        With my passion for woodworking I have done projects like a cutting bored and a cheese slicer along with a entertainment stand and a dresser for a family member. </p>
      </p>
      <h3>Beyond Technology: Automotive Enthusiast</h3>
      <p>Beyond my technical skills, I also have a strong passion for the world of automobiles. I have a passion for cars and trucks especially 
        classic vehicles with more of a classic look to them but I do not work on any EV cars as of right now. </p>
